Blog-on-Rails
=============

A blog based web application created using Ruby on Rails framework

Incrementally developed a fully-functional web application from scratch. 
The web application supports blogging, and includes a database on the back end, 
an appropriately configured middleware, 
along with the code for displaying blog posts and comments in a user's browser. 
That is, it is an example of a "full stack" web application.


## Installation Instructions
In	this	section	I	will	detail	the	most	important	software	products	and	tools	that	I	
have used for this project.		
• RVM	(Ruby	Version	Manager)	– A	command-line	tool	that	allows	you	to	
install,	manage	and	work	with	multiple	Ruby	programming	language	
versions.		You	should	install	this	first,	and	then	use	it	to	install	the	latest	
stable	version	of	Ruby.		To	check	to	see	if	you	have	RVM	installed,	at	the	
command	prompt in	a	terminal	window,	type:
$ rvm	–v
If	you	type	the	following	command:
$	rvm	list	known
You	will	see	a	list	of	the	Ruby	versions	you	have	installed.
A	list	of	all	rvm	commands	is	provided	by	typing:
$	rvm	help

• Ruby	– As	mentioned	above,	after	installing	RVM,	use	it	to	install	the	Ruby	
programming	language.		Generally,	this	is	accomplished	typing	the	following	
command	in	your	terminal	window:
$	rvm	install	ruby
This should	install	the	latest	stable	version	of	Ruby.		You	can	use	the	previous	
command	to	list	the	Ruby	version	you	have	installed,	and	you	can	also	see	the	
current	default	version	you	are	using	by	typing:
$	ruby	–v

• Ruby	on	Rails	(Rails)	– Rails	is	a	Ruby	software package	(library).		In	Ruby,	it	
is	common	to	use	the	RubyGems	package	management,	and	the	package	
themselves	are	then	referred	to	as	Gems.		To	learn	more	about	Gems,	see:	
http://guides.rubygems.org
To	install	the	Rails	gem,	at	your	command	prompt, type:
$	gem	install	rails
This	should	install	the	latest	stable	release	of	Rails.		To	check	the	version	you	
have	installed	type:
$	rails	-v

Then	you’re	good	to	go!
